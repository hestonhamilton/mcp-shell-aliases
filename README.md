# Gemini Shell Aliases Extension

## Overview

This extension for the Gemini CLI makes your shell aliases available to Gemini. It parses your shell configuration files (like `.bashrc`, `.bash_aliases`, `.zshrc`, etc.) and exposes the aliases as custom commands in the Gemini CLI.

## How it Works

This extension uses a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** to:
1.  Read your shell alias files.
2.  Parse the alias definitions.
3.  Register each alias as a new command in the Gemini CLI.

For example, an alias `alias ll='ls -alF'` will be exposed as a command `/ll`. When you run `/ll` in the Gemini CLI, the extension will execute the command `ls -alF` and display the output.

## Features

*   Parses shell alias definitions from common shell configuration files.
*   Exposes aliases as custom commands in the Gemini CLI.
*   Supports `bash` aliases.
*   Planned support for other shells like `zsh`, `fish`, etc.
*   Configuration options to specify custom alias file paths.

## Supported Shells

*   [ ] Bash (`.bashrc`, `.bash_aliases`)
*   [ ] Zsh (`.zshrc`)
*   [ ] Fish (`.config/fish/config.fish`)

## Installation

> This section will be updated once the extension is published.

## Usage

1.  Configure the paths to your alias files in the `gemini-extension.json` file.
2.  Install and enable the extension.
3.  Use your aliases as commands in the Gemini CLI (e.g., `/ll`).

## Configuration

You can configure the paths to your alias files in the `gemini-extension.json` file.

Example `gemini-extension.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "shell-aliases",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Exposes shell aliases to Gemini CLI.",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "mcp_server": {
    "command": ["node", "${extensionPath}/dist/index.js"]
  },
  "configuration": {
    "aliasFiles": [
      "./.bashrc",
      "./.bash_aliases"
    ]
  }
}
```
